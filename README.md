# Pranayama

This little Ruby script prints box breathing instructions, which are useful to keep focused/relax when waiting for tests to complete, or some other task where I'd otherwise be tempted to check Facebook or dive into some other distraction.

This breathing technique is part of the many pranayama's and called box breathing by the Navy Seals and PhDs (https://goo.gl/e9rSgd, https://goo.gl/HTWK3W), Samavritti pranayama by the yogis (https://goo.gl/gNTP71). The final link has instructions on how to do the exercise.

## Usage

Just call the executable script:

`> ./pranayama`

The default breathing pattern is 4-4-8-4 (breathe in 4 seconds, hold 4, breathe out 8, hold 4). To change that,
call the script with an alternate pattern like this:

`> ./pranayama 3-3-6-3`
